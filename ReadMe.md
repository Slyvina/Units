# Slyvina Units

These are the base units of Slyvina. The name "unit" stuck with me due to my history as a Turbo Pascal coder. These are all base features to get any project using Slyvina on the road.
Also note that Slyvina is also meant to make sure that my projects, could in the future be more easily portable to other OSes. Some "Units" that are now written for Window only are designed to it that code for Mac or Linux or 
whatever should be possible in the future (of course, if you wanna help me, you can also throw me a pull request. I'd be grateful if you did).

Now primary Slyvina was written for my own benefit, but whoever thinks they can use Slyvina in their own projects is free to do so, and yes, I don't mind forks of Slyvina as long as the license and copyright of the original code is 
kept in order (most of these files are zlib-licensed).
